<section name="Tomcat 8.0.0-RC10 (alpha) Released" rtext="2013-12-26">
<p>
The Apache Tomcat Project is proud to announce the next release candidate for
Apache Tomcat 8  - 8.0.0-RC10 (alpha). Tomcat 8 is aligned with Java EE 7. In
addition to supporting updated versions of the Java EE specifications, Tomcat 8
includes a number of improvements compared to Tomcat 7. The notable changes
include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for Java Servlet 3.1, JavaServer Pages 2.3, Java Unified
      Expression Language 3.0 and Java WebSocket 1.0.</li>
  <li>The default connector implementation is now the Java non-blocking
      implementation (NIO) for both HTTP and AJP.</li>
  <li>A new resources implementation that replaces Aliases, VirtualLoader, 
      VirtualDirContext, JAR resources and external repositories with a single,
      consistent approach for configuring additional web application resources.
      The new resources implementation can also be used to implement overlays
      (using a master WAR as the basis for multiple web applications that each
      have their own customizations).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC10 includes numerous fixes for issues identified in RC5 as
well as a number of other enhancements and changes. The notable changes since
RC5 include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extending the new resources implementation to include resource handling
      for class loaders and the addition of a new feature to track the code
      responsible for an open file.</li>
  <li>Complete refactoring of TLD handling including the addition of caching of
      parsed TLDs to improve performance.</li>
  <li>Improvements to JMX MBeans including better visibility of DBCP connection
      pools and improved organisation in the default JConsole view.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Full details of these changes, and all the other changes, are available in the
<a href="tomcat-8.0-doc/changelog.html">Tomcat 8 changelog</a>.
</p>

<p>The purpose of this release candidate is to give users an opportunity to test
Tomcat 8 and provide feedback to the Tomcat community. It has been given an
alpha status which means that it is not judged as being ready for production
usage. The implementations of the 4 Java EE 7 specifications are all complete
but there is a small amount of refactoring to be completed before the alpha
label is removed.</p>

<section name="Tomcat 7.0.39 Released" rtext="2013-03-26">
<p>
The Apache Tomcat Project is proud to announce the release of version 7.0.39 of
Apache Tomcat. This release contains a number of bug fixes and improvements
compared to version 7.0.37. The notable changes include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There have been multiple improvements in the bytes to/from characters
    conversion process. The core conversion process has been refactored to use
    the NIO APIs. This has resulted in a number of improvements including
    invalid UTF-8 byte sequences at the end of a series of bytes now trigger a
    conversion error rather than being silently swallowed. Errors detected in
    request URIs will be replaced with the replacement character (allowing the
    application to respond to the invalid URI as it wishes) and errors in
    request bodies will trigger an IOException. The use of the JVM provided
    UTF-8 decoder has been replaced by a better UTF-8 decoder derived from
    Apache Harmony. This improved decoder has earlier detection of error
    conditions and more closely follows the Unicode specification regarding the
    use of replacement characters.</li>
<li>The annotation scanning process now provides more information if the scan
    fails due to broken class dependencies. There is now enough information to
    identify the class(es) at fault. The JAR scanning process that supports
    annotation scanning has also seen multiple improvements and fixes including
    the exclusion by default of the Bootstrap class path from the scan.</li>
<li>Upgraded a number of Tomcat&apos;s dependencies including Commons Daemon to
    1.0.14, Commons IO to 2.4 and Commons FileUpload to r1458500. A new
    dependency on Commons Codec was added to replace Tomcat's internal Base64
    encoder/decoder.</li>

The Apache Tomcat Project is proud to announce the release of version 7.0.37 of
Apache Tomcat. This release contains a small number of bug fixes and

<ul>
<li>Fix the regression in the JspC tool that is used to pre-compile JSP pages

    <a href="https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54440">issue
    54440</a> for details. Patch provided by Sheldon Shao.</li>
<li>Improve handling of <code>ciphers</code> and
    <code>sslEnabledProtocols</code> options for the BIO and NIO connectors. The
    behaviour of each connector is now the same. The values provided are pruned
    to those supported by the SSL implementation and when none of the remaining
    values are supported a warning is issued and the connector configured with
    an empty set of options (which essentially disables HTTPS support).</li>
<li>Update to Commons Daemon 1.0.13.</li>
