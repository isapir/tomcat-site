    <p>This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
       of Apache Tomcat 8.x. Each vulnerability is given a
       <a href="security-impact.html">security impact rating</a> by the Apache
       Tomcat security team &#x2014; please note that this rating may vary from
       platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
       is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
       version with a question mark.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
       but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
       provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.</p>

    <p>Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to
       apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the
       Apache Tomcat version that you are using. For Tomcat 8.0 those are
       <a href="/tomcat-8.0-doc/building.html"><code>building.html</code></a> and
       <a href="/tomcat-8.0-doc/BUILDING.txt"><code>BUILDING.txt</code></a>.
       Both files can be found in the <code>webapps/docs</code> subdirectory
       of a binary distributive. You may also want to review the
       <a href="/tomcat-8.0-doc/security-howto.html">Security Considerations</a>
       page in the documentation.</p>

    <p>If you need help on building or configuring Tomcat or other help on
       following the instructions to mitigate the known vulnerabilities listed
       here, please send your questions to the public

    <p><strong>Important: Security Constraint Bypass</strong>
       <cve>CVE-2017-5664</cve></p>

    <p>The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that,
       when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the error that
       occurred, the original request and response are forwarded to the error
       page. This means that the request is presented to the error page with the
       original HTTP method.</p>

   <p>If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is to serve content
      of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP
      method. Tomcat's Default Servlet did not do this. Depending on the
      original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for
      static error pages including, if the DefaultServlet is configured to
      permit writes, the replacement or removal of the custom error page.</p>

    <p>Notes for other user provided error pages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unless explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP method.
          JSPs used as error pages must ensure that they handle any error
          dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.</li>

    <p>The refactoring of the HTTP connectors for 8.5.x onwards, introduced a
       regression in the send file processing. If the send file processing
       completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the

       for multiple requests which in turn could lead to unexpected errors

    <p>The handling of an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close

    <p>The code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters.
       This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted
       the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject
       data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the
       attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and/or obtain
       sensitive information from requests other then their own.</p>

    <p><strong>Low: Session Fixation</strong>

    <p>When recycling the <code>Request</code> object to use for a new request,
    the <code>requestedSessionSSL</code> field was not recycled. This meant that
    a session ID provided in the next request to be processed using the recycled
    <code>Request</code> object could be used when it should not have been. This
    gave the client the ability to control the session ID. In theory, this could
    have been used as part of a session fixation attack but it would have been
    hard to achieve as the attacker would not have been able to force the victim
    to use the 'correct' <code>Request</code> object. It was also necessary for
    at least one web application to be configured to use the SSL session ID as
    the HTTP session ID. This is not a common configuration.</p>

    <p>This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
       security manager.</p>
       
    <p>Tomcat provides several session persistence mechanisms. The
       <code>StandardManager</code> persists session over a restart. The
       <code>PersistentManager</code> is able to persist sessions to files, a
       database or a custom <code>Store</code>. The cluster implementation
       persists sessions to one or more additional nodes in the cluster. All of
       these mechanisms could be exploited to bypass a security manager. Session
       persistence is performed by Tomcat code with the permissions assigned to
       Tomcat internal code. By placing a carefully crafted object into a
       session, a malicious web application could trigger the execution of
       arbitrary code.</p>

    <p><strong>Low: Directory disclosure</strong>
       <cve>CVE-2015-5345</cve></p>

    <p>When accessing a directory protected by a security constraint with a URL
       that did not end in a slash, Tomcat would redirect to the URL with the
       trailing slash thereby confirming the presence of the directory before
       processing the security constraint. It was therefore possible for a user
       to determine if a directory existed or not, even if the user was not
       permitted to view the directory. The issue also occurred at the root of a
       web application in which case the presence of the web application was
       confirmed, even if a user did not have access.</p>

    <p>The solution was to implement the redirect in the DefaultServlet so that
       any security constraints and/or security enforcing Filters were processed
       before the redirect. The Tomcat team recognised that moving the redirect
       could cause regressions so two new Context configuration options
       (<code>mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled</code> and
       <code>mapperDirectoryRedirectEnabled</code>) were introduced. The initial
       default was <code>false</code> for both since this was more secure. 
       However, due to regressions such as
       <a href="https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58765">Bug
       58765</a> the default for <code>mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled</code>
       was later changed to true since it was viewed that the regression was
       more serious than the security risk of associated with being able to
       determine if a web application was deployed at a given path.</p>

    <p>When accessing resources via the <code>ServletContext</code> methods
       <code>getResource()</code> <code>getResourceAsStream()</code> and

       current web application. The validation was not correct and paths of the
       form <code>"/.."</code> were not rejected. Note that paths starting with
       <code>"/../"</code> were correctly rejected. This bug allowed malicious
       web applications running under a security manager to obtain a directory
       listing for the directory in which the web application had been deployed.
       This should not be possible when running under a security manager.

       thread which could lead to a denial of service.</p>

    <p>This was fixed in revision <revlink rev="1578392">1578392</revlink>.</p>

    <p>This issue was reported as a possible bug via the Tomcat users mailing
       list on 3 March 2014 and the security implications were identified by the
       Tomcat security team on the same day. This issue was made public on 27
       May 2014.</p>

    <p><strong>Important: Information disclosure</strong>
       <cve>CVE-2014-0096</cve></p>

    <p>The default servlet allows web applications to define (at multiple
       levels) an XSLT to be used to format a directory listing. When running
       under a security manager, the processing of these was not subject to the
       same constraints as the web application. This enabled a malicious web
       application to bypass the file access constraints imposed by the security
       manager via the use of external XML entities.</p>

    <p>This was fixed in revisions <revlink rev="1578610">1578610</revlink> and
       <revlink rev="1578611">1578611</revlink>.</p>

    <p>This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 27 February 2014
       and made public on 27 May 2014.</p>

    <p>Affects: 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.3</p>

    <p><strong>Important: Information disclosure</strong>
       <cve>CVE-2014-0099</cve></p>

    <p>The code used to parse the request content length header did not check
       for overflow in the result. This exposed a request smuggling
       vulnerability when Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that
       correctly processed the content length header.</p>

    <p>This was fixed in revision <revlink rev="1578812">1578812</revlink>.</p>

    <p>A test case that demonstrated the parsing bug was sent to the Tomcat
       security team on 13 March 2014 but no context was provided. The security
       implications were identified by the Tomcat security team the day the
       report was received and made public on 27 May 2014.</p>

  <p><i>Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 8.0.2 but the
       release vote for the 8.0.2 release candidates did not pass.
       Therefore, although users must download 8.0.3 to obtain a version that
       includes a fix for this issue, version 8.0.2 is not

    <p><strong>Important: Denial of Service</strong>
       <cve>CVE-2014-0050</cve></p>

    <p>It was possible to craft a malformed Content-Type header for a multipart
       request that caused Apache Tomcat to enter an infinite loop. A malicious
       user could, therefore, craft a malformed request that triggered a denial
       of service.</p>
    
    <p>The root cause of this error was a bug in Apache Commons FileUpload.
       Tomcat 8 uses a packaged renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload to
       implement the requirement of the Servlet 3.0 and later specifications to
       support the processing of mime-multipart requests. Tomcat 8 was therefore
       affected by this issue.</p>

    <p>This was fixed in revision <revlink rev="1565163">1565163</revlink>.</p>

    <p>The fix for CVE-2005-2090 was not complete. It did not cover the

    <p>Requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length

       When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat) process
       a sequence of requests where one or more requests contain either multiple
       content-length headers or a content-length header when chunked encoding
       is being used and several components do not reject the request and make
       different decisions as to which content-length header to use an attacker
       can poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and obtain sensitive
       information from requests other then their own. Tomcat now rejects

    <p><strong>Important: Denial of Service</strong>
       <cve>CVE-2017-6056</cve></p>

    <p>In February 2015 a single user reported high CPU usage (<bug>57544</bug>)
       which was traced to a tight loop. However, it was not clear how the
       conditions necessary to enter the loop were being created. There was no
       evidence that indicated that the loop was user triggerable. The only
       potential paths identified by code inspection depended on application
       bugs (retaining references to request objects and accessing after the
       request had completed).</p>

    <p>It was (and still is) believed that an application bug was the most
       likely root cause. Therefore, <bug>57544</bug> was not treated as a DoS
       vulnerability.</p>

    <p>In November 2016, <cve>CVE-2016-6816</cve> was announced. When downstream
       distributions, notably Debian, back-ported the fix for
       <cve>CVE-2016-6816</cve> they inadvertently make it trivial for users to
       trigger the tight loop from <bug>57544</bug>. This made a DoS attack
       trivial to mount and resulted in multiple reports of problems including
       <bug>60578</bug> and <bug>60581</bug>.</p>

    <p>Tomcat releases from the Apache Software Foundation were not affected as
       the ASF did not release any versions that contained the fix for
       <cve>CVE-2016-6816</cve> but not the fix for <bug>57544</bug>.</p>

    <p>This issue was first announced on 13 February 2017.</p>

    <p>Affects: Debian, Ubuntu and potentially other downstream
       distributions.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Important: Remote Memory Read</strong>
       <cve>CVE-2014-0160</cve> (a.k.a. "Heartbleed")</p>

    <p>A bug in certain versions of <a href="www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a>
        can allow an unauthenticated remote user to read certain contents of
        the server's memory. Binary versions of tcnative 1.1.24 - 1.1.29
        include this vulnerable version of OpenSSL. tcnative 1.1.30 and later
        ship with patched versions of OpenSSL.</p>

        steps to take, see the Tomcat Wiki's
        <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/Security/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a>
