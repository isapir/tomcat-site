The Apache Tomcat Project is proud to announce the release of version 8.0.22
of Apache Tomcat. Apache Tomcat 8.0.22 includes a numerous fixes for issues
identified in 8.0.21 as well as a number of other enhancements and changes. The
notable changes since 8.0.21 include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change the format of the Tomcat specific URLs for resources inside JARs
      that are in turn packed in a WAR. The <code>^/</code> sequence has been
      replaced by <code>*/</code> so that the resulting URLs are compliant with
      RFC 2396 and do not trigger exceptions when converted to URIs. The old
      format will continue to be accepted.</li>
  <li>Allow logging of the remote port in the access log using the format
      pattern <code>%{remote}p</code>.</li>
  <li>When checking last modified times as part of the automatic deployment
      process, account for the fact that File.lastModified() has a resolution of
      one second to ensure that if a file has been modified within the last
      second, the latest version of the file is always used. Note that a
      side-effect of this change is that files with modification times in the
      future are treated as if they are unmodified.</li>
  <li>Align redeploy resource modification checking with reload modification
      checking so that now, in both cases, a change in modification time rather
      than an increase in modification time is used to determine if the resource
      has changed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: There is a known issue with NIO2 and SSL/TLS in this and previous releases
that can result in dropped connections. It is not recommended that NIO2 is used
in production with SSL/TLS until this issue is resolved (the fix is expected in
8.0.23).
