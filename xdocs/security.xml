    <p>Please note that, except in rare circumstances, binary patches are not
       produced for individual vulnerabilities. To obtain the binary fix for a
       particular vulnerability you should upgrade to an Apache Tomcat version
       where that vulnerability has been fixed.</p>
       
    <p>Source patches, usually in the form of references to SVN commits, may be
       provided in either in a vulnerability announcement and/or the
       vulnerability details listed on these pages. These source patches may be
       used by users wishing to build their own local version of Tomcat with just
       that security patch rather than upgrade. Please note that an exercise is
       currently underway to add links to the svn commits for all the
       vulnerabilities listed on these pages.</p>

  <section name="Reporting New Security Problems with Apache Tomcat">
    <p>The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating
       security problems and denial of service attacks against Apache Tomcat.
       </p>

    <p>We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to our private
       security mailing list first, before disclosing them in a public forum.
       </p>

    <p><strong>Please note that the security mailing list should only be used
       for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat and
       managing the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept
       regular bug reports or other queries at this address. All mail sent to
       this address that does not relate to an undisclosed security problem in
       the Apache Tomcat source code will be ignored.</strong></p>

    <p>If you need to report a bug that isn't an undisclosed security
       vulnerability, please use the <a href="bugreport.html">bug reporting
       page</a>.</p>
       
    <p>Questions about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>how to configure Tomcat securely</li>
      <li>if a vulnerability applies to your particular application</li>
      <li>obtaining further information on a published vulnerability</li>
      <li>availability of patches and/or new releases</li>
    </ul>
    <p>should be addressed to the users mailing list. Please see the
       <a href="lists.html">mailing lists</a> page for details of how to
       subscribe.</p>
    
    <p>The private security mailing address is:
       <a href="mailto:security@tomcat.apache.org">
       security@tomcat.apache.org</a></p>

    <p>Note that all networked servers are subject to denial of service attacks,
       and we cannot promise magic workarounds to generic problems (such as a
       client streaming lots of data to your server, or re-requesting the same
       URL repeatedly). In general our philosophy is to avoid any attacks which
       can cause the server to consume resources in a non-linear relationship to
       the size of inputs.</p>
