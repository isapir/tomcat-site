<section name="Tomcat 7.0.23 Released" rtext="2011-11-25">
<p>
The Apache Tomcat Project is proud to announce the release of version 7.0.23 of
Apache Tomcat. This release includes numerous bug fixes and several new features
compared to version 7.0.22. The notable new features include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to start and stop child containers (primarily Contexts - i.e.
    web applications) in parallel which can significantly improve start times.
    This is disabled by default but can be enabled by setting the
    <code>startStopThreads</code> attribute of a <strong>Host</strong> to a
    value greater than one.</li>
<li>Cache the results of parsing the global and host level context.xml files to
    improve start times.</li>
<li>Improve the handling of failed deployments so that a broken application
    can be fixed (e.g. via JMX) and another attempt made to start it rather than
    it having to be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Full details of these changes, and all the other changes, are available in the
<a href="tomcat-7.0-doc/changelog.html#Tomcat_7.0.23_(markt)">Tomcat 7 changelog</a>.
