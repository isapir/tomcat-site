release, it is expected to run stably and is being used in production at the
ASF for the ASF&apos;s Jira instance. The beta status is primarily because the
Tomcat developers feel more feedback is required before a stable release. It is
also because 8.0.3 depends on a snapshot rather than a release build of Apache
Commons DBCP2 and because there may be a small amount of further refactoring.

<section name="Tomcat 8.0.1 (beta) Released" rtext="2014-02-02">
<p>
The Apache Tomcat Project is proud to announce the release of version 8.0.1
(beta) of Apache Tomcat. Tomcat 8 is aligned with Java EE 7. In addition to
supporting updated versions of the Java EE specifications, Tomcat 8
includes a number of improvements compared to Tomcat 7. The notable changes
include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for Java Servlet 3.1, JavaServer Pages 2.3, Java Unified
      Expression Language 3.0 and Java WebSocket 1.0.</li>
  <li>The default connector implementation is now the Java non-blocking
      implementation (NIO) for both HTTP and AJP.</li>
  <li>A new resources implementation that replaces Aliases, VirtualLoader, 
      VirtualDirContext, JAR resources and external repositories with a single,
      consistent approach for configuring additional web application resources.
      The new resources implementation can also be used to implement overlays
      (using a master WAR as the basis for multiple web applications that each
      have their own customizations).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Apache Tomcat 8.0.1 (beta) includes numerous fixes for issues identified in RC10
as well as a number of other enhancements and changes. The notable changes since
RC10 include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fix sendFile support for the NIO connector.</li>
  <li>Move control of caching and linking options from the Context to the
      WebResourceRoot to enable them to by changed while the web application is
      running.</li>
  <li>Add support for a dedicated listener for class loader binding and
      unbinding events.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Full details of these changes, and all the other changes, are available in the
<a href="tomcat-8.0-doc/changelog.html#Tomcat_8.0.1_(markt)">Tomcat 8 changelog</a>.
</p>

<p>The purpose of this beta release is to give users an opportunity to test
Tomcat 8 and to provide feedback to the Tomcat community. Although it is a beta
release, it is expected to run stably and is being used in production at the
ASF for the ASF&apos;s Jira instance. The beta status is primarily because the
Tomcat developers feel more feedback is required before a stable release. It is
also because 8.0.1 depends on a snapshot rather than a release build of Apache
Commons DBCP2 and because there may be a small amount of further refactoring.
