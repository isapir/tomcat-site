<section name="End of life for Apache Tomcat 5.5.x" rtext="2011-08-10">
<p>The Apache Tomcat team announces that support for Apache Tomcat 5.5.x
will end on 30 September 2012.</p>

<p>This means that after 30 September 2012:</p>
<ul>
  <li>releases from the 5.5.x branch are highly unlikely</li>
  <li>bugs affecting only the 5.5.x branch will not be addressed</li>
  <li>security vulnerability reports will not be checked against the 5.5.x
    branch</li>
</ul>

<p>Three months later (i.e. after 31 December 2012)</p>
<ul>
  <li>the 5.5.x download pages will be removed</li>
  <li>the latest 5.5.x release will be removed from the mirror system</li>
  <li>the 5.5.x branch in svn will move from <code>/tomcat/tc5.5.x</code> to
    <code>/tomcat/archive/tc5.5.x</code></li>
  <li>the links to the 5.5.x documentation will be removed from
    tomcat.apache.org</li>
  <li>The bugzilla project for 5.5.x will be made read-only</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that all 5.5.x releases will always be available from the archive.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that the final 5.5.x release will be made shortly
before 30 September 2012.</p>
