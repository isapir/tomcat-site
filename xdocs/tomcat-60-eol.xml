<section name="End of life for Apache Tomcat 6.0.x" rtext="2015-06-03">
<p>The Apache Tomcat team announces that support for Apache Tomcat 6.0.x
will end on 31 December 2016.</p>

<p>This means that after 31 December 2016:</p>
<ul>
  <li>releases from the 6.0.x branch are highly unlikely</li>
  <li>bugs affecting only the 6.0.x branch will not be addressed</li>
  <li>security vulnerability reports will not be checked against the 6.0.x
    branch</li>
</ul>

<p>Three months later (i.e. some time after 30 March 2017)</p>
<ul>
  <li>the 6.0.x download pages will be removed</li>
  <li>the latest 6.0.x release will be removed from the mirror system</li>
  <li>the 6.0.x branch in svn will move from <code>/tomcat/tc6.0.x</code> to
    <code>/tomcat/archive/tc6.0.x</code></li>
  <li>the links to the 6.0.x documentation will be removed from
    tomcat.apache.org</li>
  <li>The bugzilla project for 6.0.x will be made read-only</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that all 6.0.x releases will always be available from the archive.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that the final 6.0.x release will be made shortly
before 31 December 2016.</p>
