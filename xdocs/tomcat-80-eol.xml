<section name="End of life for Apache Tomcat 8.0.x" rtext="2017-06-30">
<p>The Apache Tomcat team announces that support for Apache Tomcat 8.0.x
will end on 30 June 2018.</p>

<p>This means that after 30 June 2018:</p>
<ul>
  <li>releases from the 8.0.x branch are highly unlikely</li>
  <li>bugs affecting only the 8.0.x branch will not be addressed</li>
  <li>security vulnerability reports will not be checked against the 8.0.x
    branch</li>
</ul>

<p>Three months later (i.e. after 30 September 2018)</p>
<ul>
  <li>the 8.0.x download links will be removed</li>
  <li>the latest 8.0.x release will be removed from the mirror system</li>
  <li>the 8.0.x branch in svn will move from <code>/tomcat/tc8.0.x</code> to
    <code>/tomcat/archive/tc8.0.x</code></li>
  <li>the links to the 8.0.x documentation will be removed from
    tomcat.apache.org</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that all 8.0.x releases will always be available from the archive.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that the final 8.0.x release will be made shortly
before 30 June 2018.</p>
