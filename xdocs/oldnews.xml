<section name="Tomcat 9.0.0.M26 (alpha) Released" rtext="2017-08-08">
<p>
The Apache Tomcat Project is proud to announce the release of version 9.0.0.M26
(alpha) of Apache Tomcat. The is a milestone release of the 9.0.x branch and has
been made to provide users with early access to the new features in Apache
Tomcat 9.0.x so that they may provide feedback. The notable changes compared to
9.0.0.M22 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>When generating JSP runtime error messages that quote the relevant JSP
    source code, switch from using the results of the JSP page parsing process
    to using the JSR 045 source map data to identify the correct part of the JSP
    source from the stack trace. This significantly reduces the memory footprint
    of Jasper in development mode, provides a small performance improvement for
    error page generation and enables source quotes to continue to be provided
    after a Tomcat restart.</li>
<li>Add LoadBalancerDrainingValve, a Valve designed to reduce the amount of time
    required for a node to drain its authenticated users</li>
<li>Improve the Default Servlet's handling of static files when the file
    encoding is not compatible with the required response encoding.</li>
<li>Add support for a Tomcat specific deployment descriptor,
    <code>/WEB-INF/tomcat-web.xml</code>. This descriptor has an identical
    format to <code>/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>. The Tomcat descriptor takes
    precedence over any settings in conf/web.xml but does not take precedence
    over any settings in <code>/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>.</li>
<li>Add ExtractingRoot, a new WebResourceRoot implementation that extracts JARs
    to the work directory for improved performance when deploying packed WAR
    files.</li>
<li>Add support to the WebSocket client for following redirects when attempting
    to establish a WebSocket connection. Patch provided by J Fernandez.</li>
